# ACS Teams Phone Extensibility Resource Account Authorization Manager

A PowerShell script to manage authorization of Teams Phone Resource Accounts to interact with Azure Communication Services (ACS) resources.

## Overview

This tool provides a simple way to authorize, check, and remove authorization for Teams Phone Resource Accounts to work with Azure Communication Services through signed HTTP requests using HMAC-SHA256 authentication.

## Features

- **Authorize Resource Accounts**: Grant a Teams Phone Resource Account permission to interact with an ACS resource (PUT request)
- **Check Authorization Status**: Verify if a Resource Account is authorized (GET request)
- **Remove Authorization**: Revoke a Resource Account's access to an ACS resource (DELETE request)

## Prerequisites

- PowerShell 5.1 or later
- Access to Azure Communication Services resource
- Teams Phone Resource Account Object ID
- Microsoft Entra Tenant ID

## Required Information

Before running the script, you'll need to gather the following information:

1. **ACS Endpoint**: The URL of your Azure Communication Services resource (without trailing slash)
   - Example: `https://your-acs-resource.europe.communication.azure.com`

2. **Access Key**: Your ACS resource's access key (Base64 encoded)
   - Found in Azure Portal → Your ACS Resource → Keys
   - Note: the access key you find in the page at the point above is already in Base64 format, so it is sufficient to copy/paste it.

3. **Resource Account Object ID**: The Object ID of your Teams Phone Resource Account
   - Found in Microsoft Entra → Enterprise Applications → Your Resource Account

4. **Tenant ID**: Your Microsoft Entra Tenant ID (required only for PUT and DELETE operations)
   - Found in Azure Portal → Azure Active Directory → Overview

## Usage

### 1. Configure Variables

Edit the script and set the following variables:

```powershell
$acsEndpoint = "https://your-acs-resource.europe.communication.azure.com"
$accessKey = "your-acs-access-key"
$resourceAccountObjectID = "your-resource-account-object-id"
$tenantID = "your-tenant-id"
```

### 2. Choose Operation

Uncomment the relevant section based on the operation you want to perform:

#### Authorize a Resource Account (PUT)

Uncomment the `### PUT SECTION ###` to grant authorization:

```powershell
# Uncomment lines 156-171 in the script
```

Expected response: `201 Created` on success

#### Check Authorization Status (GET)

Uncomment the `### GET SECTION ###` to verify authorization:

```powershell
# Uncomment lines 202-221 in the script
```

Expected responses:
- `200 OK` - Resource Account is authorized
- `404 Not Found` - Resource Account is not authorized

#### Remove Authorization (DELETE)

Uncomment the `### DELETE SECTION ###` to revoke authorization:

```powershell
# Uncomment lines 176-194 in the script
```

Expected response: `204 No Content` on success

### 3. Run the Script

Execute the script in PowerShell:

```powershell
.\ResourceAccountAuthorizationToACS.ps1
```

## API Version

This script uses the ACS Teams Extension API version `2025-06-30`.

## Security Considerations

⚠️ **Important Security Notes:**

- Never commit your access keys to version control
- Store access keys securely (e.g., Azure Key Vault, environment variables)
- Rotate access keys regularly
- Use appropriate access controls for the script file

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**401 Unauthorized**
- Verify your access key is correct
- Ensure the access key hasn't been regenerated in Azure Portal

**404 Not Found**
- Check that the Resource Account Object ID is correct
- Verify the Tenant ID matches your Azure AD tenant

**400 Bad Request**
- Ensure the ACS endpoint URL is correct
- Verify the API version is supported

## Response Status Codes

| Code | Operation | Meaning |
|------|-----------|---------|
| 200 OK | GET | Resource Account is authorized |
| 201 Created | PUT | Authorization created successfully |
| 204 No Content | DELETE | Authorization removed successfully |
| 400 Bad Request | All | Invalid request format |
| 401 Unauthorized | All | Invalid or expired access key |
| 404 Not Found | GET | Resource Account not authorized |

## Example Workflow

1. **Initial Setup**: Configure variables with your ACS and Resource Account details
2. **Authorize**: Uncomment PUT section and run script
3. **Verify**: Uncomment GET section and run script to confirm authorization
4. **Remove (if needed)**: Uncomment DELETE section and run script
